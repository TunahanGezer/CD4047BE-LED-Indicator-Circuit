# CD4047BE LED Indicator Circuit

This project features a simple LED indicator circuit using the **CD4047BE** IC. The circuit uses a square wave oscillator to make an LED blink at a specific frequency.

## Circuit Schematic

The circuit schematic is included in the project files. It shows the connections of the CD4047BE IC and the components used in the circuit.

## Components Used

- **1 x CD4047BE** - Oscillator IC
- **1 x LED** - Indicator LED
- **7 x Resistor**
- **2 x Capacitor** - C1, C2 (timing capacitors)

## Circuit Operation

The circuit operates with the CD4047BE in astable mode, generating a square wave signal. This signal makes the LED blink at regular intervals. The values of the resistors and capacitors used in the circuit determine the oscillation frequency. You can modify the frequency by changing the component values.

## Project Details

- A simple astable oscillator circuit is designed using the **CD4047BE** IC.
- The LED blinks at a specific frequency based on the square wave output.
- The project teaches how to adjust the oscillation frequency using timing elements (R1, R2, C1, C2).

## How to Use

1. Place all the components according to the circuit schematic.
2. Connect the resistors and capacitors to run the CD4047BE in astable mode.
3. Power the circuit with the appropriate voltage and observe the LED blinking.
4. Change the resistors and capacitors to adjust the oscillation frequency.
